Cookbook
========

This is a repository for short and sweet examples and links for useful xarray recipes. We encourage users to add to this documentation.

Adding interesting links and/or inline examples to this section is a great First Pull Request.

Simplified, condensed, new-user friendly, in-line examples have been inserted where possible to augment the Stack-Overflow and GitHub links. Many of the links contain expanded information, above what the in-line examples offer.

Pandas (pd), Numpy (np) and xarray (xr) are the only abbreviated imported modules. The rest are kept explicitly imported for newer users.

These examples are written for python 3.4. Minor tweaks might be necessary for earlier python versions.
